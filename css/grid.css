/*
  Define the size of a grid block. Blocks are flex items. By default, they stretch to fill all available space, based on the size of sibling blocks. This is the "expand" behavior.

  If set to "shrink", the block will contract and only fill as much space as it needs for its content.

  If set to a number, the block will be given a percentage width, based on the total number of columns (12 by default). Percentage widths don't work if a block is inside a vertical grid.

  @group grid

  @param {number|string} $size - Sizing behavior of the block. Should be expand, shrink, or a number.

  @output The flex-basis, flex-grow, and flex-shrink properties.
*/
/*
  Set the orientation of blocks within this block. The grid is re-oriented by changing the flex direction of the block.

  @group grid

  @param {string} $orientation - Direction of the grid, either horizontal or vertical.

  @output A flex-flow property to match the direction given.
*/
/*
  Stretch a grid's child blocks across its cross-axis, making every column appear to have the same height.

  @group grid

  @param {bool} $stretch - Stretch blocks if true, or align blocks to top if false.

  @output Sets align-items to "stretch" if $stretch is true, or "flex-start" (the default value) if false.
*/
/*
  Set the alignment of blocks within a grid.

  left: Items align to the left.
  right: Items align to the right.
  center: Items align to the center.
  justify: Items are spaced equally apart so they occupy the space of the entire grid.
  spaced: Items are given equal space to their left and right.

  @group grid

  @param {string} $align - Alignment to use.

  @output An appropriate justify-content value.
*/
/*
  Set the source order of a block. Items with lower numbers appear first. If multiple items have the same number, the one in the HTML first will appear first.

  @group grid

  @param {number} $order - Position in source order.

  @output An order property.
